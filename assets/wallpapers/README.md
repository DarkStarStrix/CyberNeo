Put your wallpapers (PNG/JPG) in this folder. On first boot, they will be copied to ~/Pictures/Wallpapers and one will be set via swaybg in Hyprland startup.

Tips:
- Use high resolution images (2560x1440 or higher) for crisp scaling.
- Keep filenames simple; the first file found is used by the default script.
